## üõ†Ô∏è Environment Setup & Requirements

To run DJ BiBi, you need to set up the Python environment and the external Lavalink server.

### 1. **External Requirements (Lavalink)**

The bot requires an external Lavalink server instance to handle audio processing.

- **Java Runtime Environment (JRE):** You must have **Java 17 or newer** installed. (Older versions like Java 8/11 will cause errors).

- **Lavalink Server:**

    - Download the latest `Lavalink.jar` from the [Lavalink GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/lavalink-devs/Lavalink/releases).

    - Create an `application.yml` file in the same directory as the ``.jar` to configure the password (e.g., `youshallnotpass`).

    - Run the server: `java -jar Lavalink.jar`

### 2. **Python Libraries & Configuration**

- Install Dependencies:

```Bash
pip install discord.py wavelink
```

- Configuration:

    - Create a file named config.py in the project root.

    - Fill in your Discord Bot Token and the Lavalink details (Host, Port, Password).

```Python
# config.py
DISCORD_TOKEN = "YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN_HERE"
LAVALINK_HOST = "127.0.0.1"
LAVALINK_PORT = 2333
LAVALINK_PASSWORD = "youshallnotpass"
Security Note: Remember to add config.py to your .gitignore file to prevent sharing sensitive tokens.
